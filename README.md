# HeaortaNet
HeaortaNet is a pre-trained model for 3D segmentation of heart and aorta from non-contrast chest CT.
 
# Model Overview
Inspired by SegResNet [1], we modified the model structure with bottleneck residual block and adding attention gate. This model is called HeaortaNet.

## Data
The model was trained to segment the heart and aorta based on non-contrast chest CT. Based on our own split, the labeled dataset from Nation Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) was partioned into 60 training data, 20 validation data and 20 testing data. We only provide 6 testing data for trialï¼Œas shown in config/seg_cardiac_datalist.json. 

For more detail, please contact Dr. Tzung-Dau Wang (tdwang@ntu.edu.tw) and Prof. Wei-Chung Wang (wwang@math.ntu.edu.tw).

## Training configuration
The provided training configuration required 48GB GPU memory.

Model Input Shape: 160 x 160 x 160

Training Script: train.sh

## Input and output formats
### Input:
 Single channel chest CT images with fixed spacing (1x1x1 mm).
### Output:
 Three channels for heart, ascending & descending aorta.

## Scores
This Dice score on the testing data achieved by this model is 0.94 (heart) and 0.9 (ascending & descending aorta).
